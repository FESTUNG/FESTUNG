%> @brief Third step of the four-part algorithm in the main loop.
%>
%> The main loop repeatedly executes four steps until the parameter
%> <code>problemData.isFinished</code> becomes <code>true</code>.
%> These four steps are:
%>
%>  1. preprocessStep()
%>  2. solveStep()
%>  3. postprocessStep()
%>  4. outputStep()
%> 
%> This routine is executed third in each loop iteration.
%> It brings the linearized new solution back to the representation matrix
%> form and decides whether the main loop is to be terminated (i.e., the
%> end of the simulation time is reached).
%>
%> @param  problemData  A struct with problem parameters, precomputed
%>                      fields, and solution data structures, as provided 
%>                      by configureProblem() and preprocessProblem(). 
%>                      @f$[\text{struct}]@f$
%> @param  nStep        The current iteration number of the main loop. 
%>
%> @retval problemData  The input struct enriched with post-processed data
%>                      for this loop iteration. @f$[\text{struct}]@f$
