%> @brief Third step of the three-part substepping algorithm for each Runge-Kutta stage.
%>
%> The routine iterateSubSteps() repeatedly executes three steps until the 
%> parameter <code>problemData.isSubSteppingFinished</code> becomes 
%> <code>true</code>.
%> These three steps are:
%>
%>  1. preprocessSubStep()
%>  2. solveSubStep()
%>  3. postprocessSubStep()
%> 
%> This routine is executed third in each loop iteration.
%> It decides whether the substepping is finished and updates
%> <code>problemData.isSubSteppingFinished</code> accordingly.
%>
%> @param  problemData  A struct with problem parameters, precomputed
%>                      fields, and solution data structures (either filled
%>                      with initial data or the solution from the previous
%>                      loop iteration), as provided by configureProblem()  
%>                      and preprocessProblem(). @f$[\text{struct}]@f$
%> @param  nStep        The current iteration number of the main loop. 
%> @param  nSubStep     The current iteration number of the substepping.
%>
%> @retval problemData  The input struct enriched with postprocessed data
%>                      for this loop iteration. @f$[\text{struct}]@f$
