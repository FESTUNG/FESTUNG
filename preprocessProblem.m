%>
%> This routine is called after template/configureProblem.m.
%>
%> Typically, this step consists of grid generation, computation of derived
%> data structures, pre-computing often needed values (e.g., basis
%> functions on quadrature points), or assembly of time-independent matrix
%> blocks.
%>
%> @param  problemData  A struct with problem parameters, as provided by
%>                      configureProblem(). @f$[\text{struct}]@f$
%>
%> @retval problemData  A struct with all necessary parameters and definitions
%>                      for the problem description and precomputed fields.
