%> This routine is called after template/preprocessProblem.m.
%>
%> Before entering the main loop of the solution algorithm, this routine
%> fills the problem's data structures with initial data.
%>
%> @param  problemData  A struct with problem parameters and precomputed
%>                      fields, as provided by configureProblem() and 
%>                      preprocessProblem(). @f$[\text{struct}]@f$
%>
%> @retval problemData  The input struct enriched with initial data.
%>                      @f$[\text{struct}]@f$
