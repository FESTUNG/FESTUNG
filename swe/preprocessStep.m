%> @brief First step of the four-part algorithm in the main loop.
%>
%> The main loop repeatedly executes four steps until the number of
%> iterations provided by configureProblem in the parameter
%> <code>numSteps</code> is reached. These four steps are:
%>
%>  1. preprocessStep()
%>  2. solveStep()
%>  3. postprocessStep()
%>  4. outputStep()
%> 
%> This routine is executed first in each loop iteration.
%>
%> @param  problemData  A struct with problem parameters, precomputed
%>                      fields, and solution data structures (either filled
%>                      with initial data or the solution from the previous
%>                      loop iteration), as provided by configureProblem()  
%>                      and preprocessProblem(). @f$[\text{struct}]@f$
%> @param  nStep        The current iteration number of the main loop. 
%>
%> @retval problemData  The input struct enriched with preprocessed data
%>                      for this loop iteration. @f$[\text{struct}]@f$
