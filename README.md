FESTUNG
======
**FESTUNG** (Finite Element Simulation Toolbox for Unstructured Grids) is a Matlab / GNU Octave toolbox for the discontinuous Galerkin method on unstructured grids. It is primarily intended as a fast and flexible prototyping platform and testbed for students and developers. 

FESTUNG relies on fully vectorized matrix/vector operations to deliver optimized computational performance combined with a compact, user-friendly interface and a comprehensive documentation.

## Download
* Tarballs of the code and further information about the project can be found on our [Project page](https://math.fau.de/FESTUNG).
* The latest development versions can always be downloaded from the [Github repository](https://github.com/FESTUNG/project).

## Usage
To check out the latest development version, run `git clone https://github.com/FESTUNG/project.git`

Have a look at the script file `main.m`, where parameters for the computation are set and the algorithm is implemented. In MATLAB / GNU Octave, run 

    $ main

to start the computation.

Output files are written in [VTK format](http://www.vtk.org/VTK/img/file-formats.pdf) and can be visualized, e.g., using [Paraview](http://www.paraview.org/)

## Development
When developing code for or with FESTUNG we suggest to stick to the [Naming Convention](NAMING_CONVENTION.md) to allow for better readability and a similar appearance of all code parts. All files should be documented using the [Doxygen syntax](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/manual/).

## Documentation
All routines are carefully documented in the Doxygen format, which allows to produce [this documentation](https://www1.am.uni-erlangen.de/FESTUNG). It can be generated by calling 

    $ doxygen doxyfileFESTUNG

in the main directory.

## Contributors

FESTUNGs main developers are Florian Frank (Rice University), [Balthasar Reuter](https://math.fau.de/reuter), and [Vadym Aizinger](https://math.fau.de/aizinger). Its initial release was developed at the [Chair for Applied Mathematics I](https://www.mso.math.fau.de/applied-mathematics-1.html) at [Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-NÃ¼rnberg](https://www.fau.eu).
